# Velda

Velda is a cloud-native development, workload orchestration & HPC (High Performance Computing) platform. Directly scale your application from your development environment, no extra setup required.

## Code on Velda

Velda provides a seamless development experience.
* Connect with your favorite IDE (e.g., SSH, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), or code and run notebooks directly in your browser (hosted or enterprise only).
* Onboard new developers instantly by cloning from a pre-configured image, or customize your own.
* Compatible with most libraries, tools, or package managers. All your environment modifications and customizations are persisted and isolated from other users.

## Scale in seconds
Velda provides the simplest way to scale or run workloads with different hardware requirements:
* `vrun` is all you need. Prefix `vrun` to your command, and run your workload with the resource you requested.
* Run any workload: machine learning training, batch processing, or host a microservice cluster.
* Unbounded capacity: Access as many machines as you need from your cloud provider.
* Your environment is always consistent. All your code, data, dependencies, and environment will be mounted on the new machine.

## Save $$$
Save instantly with Velda:
* No more idle GPUs, sandboxes, or machines. Only allocate the resources you need. Stop paying for GPUs while coding or in meetings.
* Save engineering time building, updating, and maintaining container images.
* Optionally, skip Kubernetes cluster management and scale directly with VMs from your cloud provider.

# Getting started
